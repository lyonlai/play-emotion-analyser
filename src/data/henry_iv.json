And thou hast talk'dOf sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,And all the currents of a heady fight.Thy spirit within thee hath been so at warAnd thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,That beads of sweat have stood upon thy browLike bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,Such as we see when men restrain their breathOn some great sudden hest.

And thou hast talk'dOf sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,And all the currents of a heady fight.Thy spirit within thee hath been so at warAnd thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,That beads of sweat have stood upon thy browLike bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,Such as we see when men restrain their breathOn some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,And I must know it, else he loves me not."
